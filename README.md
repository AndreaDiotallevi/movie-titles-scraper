# Movie Titles Scraper

## Description

This repository contains a simple web scraping script made with Python, to save the best movies for each country in the world into a usable JSON file. This work was done to help with my final project [Moovli](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/moovli) at Makers Academy.
