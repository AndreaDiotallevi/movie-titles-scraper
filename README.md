# Movie Titles Scraper

## Description

This repository contains a simple web scraping script made with Python, to gather the best movies for all the countries in the world and save them into a usable JSON file. This work was done to help with my final project [Moovli](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/moovli) at Makers Academy.

## Prerequisites

* Download and install python at this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install the BeautifulSoup library with ```pip3 install bs4```
* Install the Requests library with ```pip3 install requests```
* Install the Unidecode library with ```pip3 install unidecode```
* To run the file and generate the JSON file type ```python3 webscraper.py```

## Technologies Used

* [Python](https://www.python.org/): a general purpose programming language I have used for web scraping.
* [BeeautifulSoup library](https://pypi.org/project/BeautifulSoup/): a Python library that allows you to pull data out of HTML and XML files.
* [Requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): a Python library that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. 
* [Unidecode library](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/): a Python library that allows you to make ASCII transliterations of Unicode text.
